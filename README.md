# Welcome to Tryand.uk

I am a developer and software architect in the UK

Here is a [presentation on Testing](/TestingSlides.html) I have written.

You can find me on twitter as [@monkeyonahill](https://twitter.com/monkeyonahill) wanting to talk about development and business but more likely retweeting about politics.
